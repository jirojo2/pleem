        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Contest is divided into two rounds.</p>
            <p>In the first (Idea Submission) round the contestants will be asked to describe their ideas for a mobile application and provide a link to the team’s repository. Every team that meets all the requirements included in the Terms and Conditions will be automatically granted an entry to the second phase of the Competition. Apart from that, each contestant will receive professional and customized feedback from the jury members.</p>
            <p>If the contestants don’t meet the deadline for submitting their idea, they will only have a chance to apply for the fourth category (Popularity). The second (Application Submission) round starts basically right after the idea submissions. The contestants will be committing their code in the repository mentioned above. The team then needs to indicate on their profile on ECA’s website that their app is ready and that the “.apk” file is ready for evaluation.</p>
