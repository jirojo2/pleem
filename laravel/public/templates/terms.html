                <p class="sublist">a. <strong>Idea Submission Round.</strong> The Competition will start with an Idea Submission Round on Thursday, November 19th 2015, at 11:00 UTC, and ends on Monday, 20th March 2016, at 23:59 UTC. All registered contestants will have to describe their ideas for a mobile application using exclusively pure text. Each team is allowed to submit one idea during this round. Once the submission of the ideas is done, the contestants will receive feedback. The contestants are guaranteed to advance to the next phase as long as they don’t break any rules listed in the Terms and Conditions. Also, ideas that are not written in proper English (i.e. impossible to comprehend) will be disqualified. If an idea is submitted after the first deadline, the contestants can only compete in the fourth category - Popularity.</p>
                <p class="sublist">b. <strong>Application Submission Round.</strong> The second round will run until Sunday, March 20, 2016 at 23:59 UTC. The code for the app should be committed on the team’s repository which the Organising Committee will have access to. This way, we want to ensure that the app was made exclusively for ECA. After the implementation is finished, the team is required to confirm that fact on their profile page (on ECA’s website) by picking the option ‘submit app’. The winning teams will be informed via e-mail, and the names of the winning teams will be published on the online pages of EESTEC and the Competition’s promotional partners.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>ENVIRONMENT</h5>
                <p>Contestants may use any programming language to implement their proposed applications, using any development environment they wish. However, there are a few restrictions:</p>
                <p class="sublist">- the final application should be a native Android application</p>
                <p class="sublist">- the code will be committed on a public repository created by the team and provided with an idea description</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>THE TOPIC</h5>

                <h5>JUDGING AND SCORING</h5>
                <p class="sublist"><strong>a. FIRST ROUND:</strong> The scoring criteria of this round are: originality, usefulness and feasibility of the proposed mobile application. Also, ideas written in a different language than English will be disqualified.  The main purpose of this phase is to emphasise all the strenghts and weaknesses of the idea so the team can work on them - that is why every team will receive professional feedback on their idea.</p>
                <p class="sublist"><strong>b. SECOND ROUND:</strong> The scoring criteria of the second round are: idea fulfillment, design, user experience, compatibility and accessibility of the implemented mobile application. Every submission will be graded on a scale of 1 to 5 by several members of the jury. The jury will not have access to any information regarding the identity of the app’s creators. An application can win in more than one category.</p>
                <p class="sublist"><strong>c. POPULARITY CATEGORY:</strong> This category is a ‘last resort’ one for all the participants that missed the first deadline, however every submission will be automatically taken into consideration here. Contestants who missed the first deadline will not receive any feedback, they will only be required to provide the organizers with a link to their repository and confirm the finalization of their app. There is no monetary prize in this category. Their app will be uploaded to ECA’s account on Google Play™, however any promotion of the app is up to the creators. The deadline for promotion is Wednesday, 6th April 2016, 23:59 UTC.</p>
